# Traffic Accident Analysis
## **Traffic Accident Analysis Report**  

### **1. Introduction**  
- Provide an overview of traffic accidents and their significance.  
- Explain the purpose of the analysis.  
- Mention the dataset used (e.g., source, number of rows and columns, and key features).  
- State the objectives, such as identifying trends, understanding contributing factors, and predicting accident severity.  

### **2. Data Understanding**  
- Describe the dataset columns, data types, and any missing values.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get insights into crash frequency, severity, time of occurrence, and other factors.  
- Use descriptive statistics and visualizations like:  
  - Histogram of crash severity.  
  - Pie chart for weather and road conditions.  
  - Time series for crash trends by month or hour.  

### **3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
- Handle missing or incorrect data.  
- Convert date and time columns to appropriate formats.  
- Encode categorical variables if necessary.  
- Scale or normalize numerical variables.  

### **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Perform in-depth analysis using visualizations such as:  
  - Bar charts and heatmaps for correlations.  
  - Boxplots for injury severity across different conditions.  
  - Geospatial maps for accident-prone areas.  
- Identify patterns in accident severity by analyzing:  
  - Time of day and day of the week.  
  - Weather and lighting conditions.  
  - Roadway surface conditions.  

### **5. Machine Learning Model Building**  
- Train and evaluate four models:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Use appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.  
- Perform hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.  
- Select the best-performing model and justify your choice.

### **6. Results and Discussion**  
- Present the key findings from the analysis.  
- Include visualizations and tables to support conclusions.  
- Explain the impact of variables on accident severity.  

---

### **7. Recommendations**  
- Suggest data-driven recommendations to improve road safety.  
- Propose potential policy interventions based on high-risk conditions.  
- Recommend further studies for deeper insights.  

---

### **8. Conclusion**  
- Summarize the main findings of the report.  
- Reflect on the effectiveness of the models used.  
- Highlight areas for future research.
